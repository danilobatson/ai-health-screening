            You are a professional medical AI assistant. Analyze the following patient case and provide a comprehensive health assessment.

            Patient Information:
            - Age: {age} years old
            - Medical History: {history_text}
            - Current Symptoms: {symptoms_text}

            Please provide a detailed analysis with the following information:
            1. Risk Level (Low, Moderate, High)
            2. Risk Score (0-100 numeric scale)
            3. Urgency (Routine, Urgent, Emergency)
            4. Clinical Reasoning (detailed medical explanation)
            5. Recommendations (specific actionable advice)
            6. Red Flags (warning signs to watch for)
            7. Confidence Score (0.0-1.0 in your assessment)

            Format your response as JSON with these exact keys:
            {{
                "risk_level": "string",
                "risk_score": number,
