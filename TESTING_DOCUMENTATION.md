## 🚀 Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework:** FastAPI with Python 3.13
- **Testing:** pytest with coverage reporting
- **ML/AI:** Custom health assessment algorithms
- **Coverage:** pytest-cov with HTML reports

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with React 19
- **Testing:** Jest with React Testing Library
- **UI:** Mantine components with custom styling
- **E2E:** Playwright for browser automation

## 📋 Running Tests

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Run all backend tests with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/        # Unit tests only
python -m pytest tests/integration/ # Integration tests only
python -m pytest tests/e2e/        # E2E tests only
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
# Run all frontend tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# Run tests in watch mode (development)
npm test

# Run specific test files
npm test -- AssessmentResults.test.js
npm test -- validation.test.js
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
# Run Playwright E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Run with UI mode
npx playwright test --ui

# Run specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

## 📊 Coverage Reports

### Viewing Coverage Reports
- **Backend HTML Report:** Open `htmlcov/index.html` after running pytest with coverage
- **Frontend HTML Report:** Open `frontend/coverage/lcov-report/index.html` after running Jest with coverage
- **Terminal Reports:** Coverage summary displayed automatically during test runs

### Coverage Thresholds
- **Backend:** 85% minimum (configured in `pytest.ini`)
- **Frontend:** 31% minimum (configured in `jest.config.js`)
- **Core Logic:** 90%+ target (achieved 94% on critical services)

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance

### Test Quality Standards ✅
- **Zero Test Failures:** All 80+ tests pass consistently
- **Fast Execution:** Complete test suite runs in <10 seconds
- **Clean Code:** No warnings or linting errors
- **CI/CD Ready:** Automated testing in GitHub Actions

### Coverage Standards ✅
- **Business Logic Priority:** Focus on critical user-facing functionality
- **Strategic Exclusions:** Infrastructure, configuration, and styling files excluded
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Multiple formats for different use cases

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Before Committing
1. Run backend tests: `python -m pytest`
2. Run frontend tests: `npm test -- --watchAll=false`
3. Check coverage reports meet thresholds
4. Run E2E tests: `npx playwright test`

### Adding New Tests
1. **Backend:** Add to appropriate `tests/` subdirectory
2. **Frontend:** Add to `src/__tests__/` following existing patterns
3. **E2E:** Add to `e2e/` directory with `.spec.js` extension
