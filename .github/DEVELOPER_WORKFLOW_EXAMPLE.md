# Developer Workflow Example

## What a Developer Sees Day-to-Day

### 1. Creating a Feature

```bash
# Developer starts new feature
git checkout -b feature/improve-ai-accuracy
# Makes changes to code
# Adds tests to maintain 90% coverage
```

### 2. Opening Pull Request

```
Developer goes to GitHub and sees:
- "Compare & pull request" button
- Creates PR with description
- Immediately sees: "Some checks haven't completed yet"
```

### 3. Quality Gates Running

```
GitHub shows status checks:
🟡 Backend Quality — Running...
🟡 Frontend Quality — Running...
🟡 E2E Quality — Running...
🟡 Security Scan — Running...

"Merge pull request" button is DISABLED
```

### 4. If Tests Pass

```
✅ Backend Quality — All tests passed (34/34), Coverage: 92%
✅ Frontend Quality — All tests passed (46/46), Coverage: 96%
✅ E2E Quality — User journeys validated
✅ Security Scan — No vulnerabilities found

"Merge pull request" button is ENABLED
Team lead can approve and merge
```

### 5. If Tests Fail

```
❌ Backend Quality — 2 tests failed, Coverage dropped to 85%
✅ Frontend Quality — All tests passed
❌ E2E Quality — Login flow broken
✅ Security Scan — No vulnerabilities found

"Merge pull request" button stays DISABLED
Developer must fix issues and push again
```

### 6. After Merge

```
Vercel automatically deploys to production
New features go live immediately
All team members get notification
```

## Why This Workflow Works

- **Developers maintain control** over their code
- **Quality is automatically enforced** without manual oversight
- **Production stays stable** because bad code can't reach it
- **Fast feedback** helps developers fix issues quickly
- **Code review process** ensures knowledge sharing

This is exactly what senior developers use at companies like Amazon, Atlassian, and healthcare companies like Iodine Software.
