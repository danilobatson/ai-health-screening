# 📋 Step-by-Step GitHub Branch Protection Setup

## Navigate to Your Repository Settings

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**

   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-health-screening
   ```

2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (next to "Code", "Issues", "Pull requests")

3. **In the left sidebar, click "Branches"**

## Add Branch Protection Rule

4. **Click "Add rule"** (green button)

5. **Branch name pattern**: Type `main`

## Configure Required Settings

6. **Check these boxes** (CRITICAL):

   ```
   ☑️ Require status checks to pass before merging
   ☑️ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   ☐ Require a pull request before merging (UNCHECK for solo development)
   ☐ Include administrators (UNCHECK to allow admin bypass)
   ```

   **Note**: For solo development, you can push directly to main, but quality gates will still run and block Vercel deployment if tests fail.

7. **Add Required Status Checks** (Type these exactly):

   In the "Status checks that are required" search box, add:

   ```
   backend-quality
   frontend-quality
   e2e-quality
   quality-gates-summary
   ```

   Note: These won't show up until you push a commit that triggers the actions!

8. **Additional Protections** (Optional but recommended):

   ```
   ☑️ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB
   ☑️ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
   ```

9. **Click "Create"** to save the rule

## Test the Setup

10. **Push a test commit**:

    ```bash
    # Make any small change (add a comment to a file)
    git add .
    git commit -m "test: trigger quality gates"
    git push origin main
    ```

11. **Watch the process**:
    - Go to your repo → "Actions" tab
    - See the quality gates running
    - Check your commit has a yellow circle (running) then green ✅ or red ❌

## Verification

12. **Check if it's working**:
    - Your commit should show status checks
    - Vercel should only deploy if all checks pass
    - If any check fails, deployment should be blocked

## What You'll See

**In GitHub:**

- Commit with ✅ = All quality gates passed → Vercel deploys
- Commit with ❌ = Quality gates failed → Vercel blocked

**In Vercel Dashboard:**

- Deployment triggered only after GitHub shows ✅
- No deployment if GitHub shows ❌

## Current Quality Gates (What Gets Checked)

Your quality gates now enforce:

1. **Backend Tests**: 34 tests must pass + 92% coverage
2. **Frontend Tests**: 46 tests must pass + 96% coverage
3. **Security**: No exposed secrets or vulnerabilities
4. **Code Quality**: Linting and formatting
5. **Build**: Code must compile successfully

## Success

Once set up, you'll have:

- ✅ **Enterprise-grade CI/CD**
- ✅ **90%+ test coverage enforced**
- ✅ **Automatic quality checks**
- ✅ **Prevented bad deployments**

This is exactly what top tech companies use!
